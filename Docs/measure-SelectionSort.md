*measure-SelectionSort.ps1*
================

This PowerShell script measures the speed of the SelectionSort algorithm.
SelectionSort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n2) time complexity,
which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar
insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and has performance advantages
over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory
is limited.

Parameters
----------
```powershell
PS> ./measure-SelectionSort.ps1 [[-numIntegers] <Int32>] [<CommonParameters>]

-numIntegers <Int32>
    Specifies the number of integers to sort
    
    Required?                    false
    Position?                    1
    Default value                1000
    Accept pipeline input?       false
    Accept wildcard characters?  false

[<CommonParameters>]
    This script supports the common parameters: Verbose, Debug, ErrorAction, ErrorVariable, WarningAction, 
    WarningVariable, OutBuffer, PipelineVariable, and OutVariable.
```

Example
-------
```powershell
PS> ./measure-SelectionSort.ps1
ðŸ§­ Sorting 1000 integers by SelectionSort took 0.3351773 sec

```
